Disadvantages of Binary threshold:
It uses only one thrshold level and compares all the pixels of the image as being either greater than or less than that
pixel value and then decides what value the pixel must take , 0 or 1,thus; a lot of information from the image could get
lost in such thresholding.


Why is adaptive Threshold better?
Adaptive thresholding is much better than binary thresholding because the value of each pixel is decided based on the 
neighbouring pixels and not the entire image as a whole. This ensures that the details of the image are preserved.
